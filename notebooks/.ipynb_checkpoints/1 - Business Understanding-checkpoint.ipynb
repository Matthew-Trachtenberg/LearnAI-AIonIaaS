    "The Team Data Science Process (TDSP) is an agile, iterative data science methodology to deliver predictive analytics solutions and intelligent applications efficiently. TDSP helps improve team collaboration and learning. It contains a distillation of the best practices and structures from Microsoft and others in the industry that facilitate the successful implementation of data science initiatives. The goal is to help companies fully realize the benefits of their analytics program.\n",

    "TDSP comprises of the following key components:\n",

They have 256 million customers worldwide. They have significant coverage in France, Spain, Belgium, Poland, Romania, Slovakia Moldova, and a large presence Africa and the Middle East. Customer Churn is always an issue in any company. Orange would like to predict the propensity of customers to switch provider (churn), buy new products or services (appetency), or buy upgrades or add-ons proposed to them to make the sale more profitable (up-selling).
