It has many popular data science and other tools pre-installed and pre-configured to jump-start building intelligent applications for advanced analytics. It is available on Windows Server and on Linux. You can use it for training, and for all phases of the Data Science process. For this workshop, we'll use two Data Science Virutal Machines - one for development, and another as both the GPU-enabled training system and the Internet of Things (IoT) target.\n",
