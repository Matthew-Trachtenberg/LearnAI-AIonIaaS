    "The [Data Science Virtual Machine](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/data-science-virtual-machine/) (DSVM) is a customized VM image on Microsoft’s Azure cloud built specifically for doing data science. It has many popular data science and other tools pre-installed and pre-configured to jump-start building intelligent applications for advanced analytics. It is available on Windows Server and on Linux. You can use it for training, and for all phases of the Data Science process. \n",

    "[The Team Data Science Process](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/team-data-science-process/overview) (TDSP) is an agile, iterative data science methodology to deliver predictive analytics solutions and intelligent applications efficiently. TDSP helps improve team collaboration and learning. It contains a distillation of the best practices and structures from Microsoft and others in the industry that facilitate the successful implementation of data science initiatives. The goal is to help companies fully realize the benefits of their analytics program. Essentially, the TDSP provides:\n",

    "Instructions:\n",
    "1. Using the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) client of your choice, connect to your DSVM using the information from the previous lab. \n",
    "2. Using Windows Update, [update all Windows components](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/3067639/how-to-get-an-update-through-windows-update). Ensure you set the update options to “Get updates for other Microsoft products” on the Windows Update home page. To enable checking for other products, click the ***Find Out More*** option shown beside this message. This will take you to the Microsoft Update site for some quick installation steps. You only need to do this once. Thereafter, the Windows Update home page will indicate that you receive updates “For Windows and other products from Microsoft Update.” . \n",
